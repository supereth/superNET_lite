Add Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin to supported MGW coins
New MGW Server API implemented, for this special server.

Added more reliable peers for the Jay service via http://nxtpeers.com/api/cors/jsonp.php
This improves the list of nodes available, as on peerexplorer they don't necessarily support CORS.

Choice of nodes to generate Msig addresses are now random from the list in dashboard.js
4 tries each coin, if not successfull it will retry to generate deposit addresses after 10 minutes.
Msig address generation now more efficient filtering for first character in address.

Changed Lockscreen Background, Nxt Account Information and publicKey Modal.
Fixed deposit status display. More error/success messages. Disabled view of advertisement boxes.
General code improvement.

Introducing new coins under development SYS and FIBRE.
